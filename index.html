      <p>Whoever you <br>
      If you ever open this<br>
      By your light<br>
      You can keep it<br>
      By the bed for your head<br>
      And arms to weigh heavy<br>
      On moulting white clouds.</p>
      <p>A raft on a plate<br>
      In the molten sea<br>
      Can close your house and<br>
      Quit you for it. You really<br>
      Can stop lying to yourself.<br>
      <p>I know to suffer<br>
      Alone is not an innovation.<br>
      You know this one<br>
      Too. And to divine<br>
      Wisdom in a purl<br>
      Of blood takes art<br>
      In this open world<br>
      You know.<br>
      <p>It takes art</p>
      <p>And you have it.</p>
